The error indicates that the `runners` input must be a comma-separated list of strings. It looks like the `runners` input in the `Autograding Reporter` step is not correctly formatted. 

Here is the corrected workflow file:

```yaml
name: Autograding Tests
'on':
  - push
  - repository_dispatch
permissions:
  checks: write
  actions: read
  contents: read
jobs:
  run-autograding-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.actor != 'github-classroom[bot]'
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install numpy
    - name: Run tests
      run: python -m unittest discover
    - name: Autograding Reporter
      uses: classroom-resources/autograding-grading-reporter@v1
      env:
        TEST_NUMPY_ARRAY_EXERCISE-PY_RESULTS: "${{steps.test_numpy_array_exercise-py.outputs.result}}"
      with:
        runners: "test_numpy_array_exercise-py"
```

This should fix the error by ensuring the `runners` input is a correctly formatted string.
